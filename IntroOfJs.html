            JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. 
            It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
            It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
             JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
             prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
